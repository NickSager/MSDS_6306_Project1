## Description

This case study is conducted to analyze data on a wide variety of American beers for Budweiser. It is our intention that the results provide an overall picture of the domestic beer market and help inform Budweiser's efforts in their future beer endeavors. The data set contains information on 2410 different beers from 558 different breweries in 50 different states.  It also contains information on the name of the beer, the name of the brewery, the state where the brewery is located, the alcohol by volume (ABV) of the beer, the International Bitterness Units (IBU) of the beer, and the style of the beer. We will predominately be focusing on the ABV and IBU of the beer, as well as the style of the beer.

## Installation
